                        <div class="running-text">The song "Anaesthetist" is about the privatisation of the National Health Service. On the song, frontman Rou Reynolds stated "We seem to have reached a stage of such capitalistic fervour, that we believe it acceptable to punish people for ill health. By charging for healthcare we act as if illness is nothing but one’s own problem, but what is the purpose and advantage of 'civilisation' if it is not helping the most </div>

                        <div class="running-text">And here it is! The second studio release from this awesome band! From their first "Take to the Skies", they have changed things in the process and production of their music. This album has less interludes ("Havoc A/B") but still pretends to unite a whole concept and be a riot against the injustice from our planet in many fields. This album wants to be wild, to be rebellious, and it has the reasons inside the lyrics, which were accurate since 2009.</div>

                        <div class="running-text">Reynolds said the album was as diverse as A Flash Flood of Colour in the sense that every track is different, "cover[ing] all corners of the musical spectrum."[8] When choosing "which of the tracks they've been working on should make it on to [the album]", Enter Shikari found it hard to decide. Therefore, they made a graph where "the vertical axis charted the heaviness of the songs [while] the horizontal one [charted] their location on a scale ranging from 'accessible' to 'experimental'", and "where clusters indicated several songs covering the same territory, only one was allowed to make the cut", so that the album would feature something "from everywhere within [the band's] spectrum of sounds."[7]</div>

They take on the dismantling of the NHS on ‘Anaesthetist’ and then the corruption of banks on ‘The Bank of England’. It’s an approach that works, as it allows the band to make sure each song can stand up in its own right. T</div>
